["A very inspiring course. We have learned a lot from this class, in terms of academic writing, major theories of contemporary and modern thoughts, arts, and essentially human civilization itself. Students benefit a lot throughout this class.", "This class covers a variety of materials, from music, up-to-date articles, to literature. Students are encouraged to express themselves. Most of all, the teacher is willing to have discussions with students and offer help. Thank you, John!"]
